           <h2 class="section-heading">Flight Safety Analysis</h2>
          <p>Although there have been recent unfortunate airline crashes and the mediaâ€™s promotion of statistics stating air travel is no longer a safe way to travel, it in fact has never been safer to travel by airplane. Airline travel has never been safer and the time saving/safety increase for travelers compared to automobile travel is a no-brainer. Average airline incidents per year is down by almost 50% compared to the previous 15 years. Average airline fatalities per airline incident has also decreased by almost 50% compared to the previous 15 years. From 1985 - 1999, the average fatalities per airline incident were about 0.30 people. Consequently, from 2000-2014, that number has dropped significantly to 0.19 average fatalities per airline incident. Although we would like to see that number drop to zero, the significant decrease over the past 15 years is encouraging nonetheless. US airline incidents follow a similar path as the overall airline industry when it comes to average incidents per 100 million miles flown. This rate has continued to steadily decrease over the past 14years and is at its lowest level since 2014. There was a slight uptick in incident rate in 2014, however, this rate has continued to decrease since then.</p>
          
          <p>The media has also suggested it is safer to travel by automobile versus airplane. Based on our analysis, we believe this to be a false narrative. From 2000 to 2014, a person was 43 times more likely to be involved in an automobile accident than an airplane incident. From 2000 to 2014, there were 1.31 incidents per 100 million miles driven in the United States. During that same time frame, there were 0.03 airline incidents per 100 million miles flown. Not only does air travel reduce the amount of time a person must take to travel, but it also reduces the chance of a person being involved in an accident.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to safety, we can see that these recent stories have unaffected the airline industry as a whole. Overall revenue for the airline industry has been unaffected and continues to move in a positive direction.nRevenue has increased by almost 20% since 2015 with no sign of slowing down. In that same time period, domestic revenue has increased by 20% and international revenue has increased by 12%. You may think this is due to raising airline prices and fuel prices, however, this is only part of the story. The total passengers and total miles flown for US flights is at an all time high and do not show any signs of decreasing. This indicates there is no raising fear by airline customers of the safety of flying. Also, the customer base is increasing and will continue to rise at a steady peace for the foreseeable future.</p>
          
          <p>Overall, we feel that flying by plane has never been safer and the recent media stories regarding this topic is inaccurate. Between the decreasing incident/fatality rates, increasing miles flown and growth in people choosing to fly in the skies, choosing planes over automobiles or other forms of transportation is a no brainer.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Project</h2>
          
          <p>Key Tasks performed for this project included:</p>
            
          <ul>
            <li>Search the internet for data to support my argument that flying was a safe mode of transportation</li>
            <li>Collect data from the internet that support this statement. This included downloading csv files, extracting data from APIs, and scraping data from various flight travel datat websites</li>
            <li>Create an infographic in Photoshop (see image at begining of the page) to present findings</li>
            <li>Create a PowerPoint presentation to review the findings to "executive leadership"</li>
            <li>Create Tableau Dashboard for interactive flight safety metrics</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p> You can review my Python Code, Tableau Dashboard, and PowerPoint Presention in my a href='https://github.com/kwwaite1129/Example-Project-Work/tree/master/Flight%20Safety%20Analysis'><b><u>GitHub Repository</b></u></a> for more details on the work I performed for this project.</p>
