           <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
          <p>Image recognition is a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of use cases throughout any domain.  “The global image recognition market size is expected to reach USD 109.4 billion by 2027, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR[Compound Annual Growth Rate] of 18.8% from 2020 to 2027”, (Grand View Research, 2020). It is quickly becoming one of the most popular projects for machine learning to automate previously manual tasks performed by a human. In order for an image recognition model to be successful, it must be able to accurately label and categorize images based on the dataset it was trained on. For my second project this semester, I will be taking the Sports Illustrated covers for the past ten years (2010-2019) and running them through a model I created to identify what sport is on the cover of the magazine. </p>

          <p>Using an image recognition model, the data entry or data governance teams at Sports Illustrated would be able to run these covers through the image recognition model and classify each cover to the sport they belong to. This model, if calibrated correctly, could also perform this classification activity with their entire image library. Instead of having an employee manually go through all of the magazine cover archives and label each magazine cover. The model would be able to do this in a matter of minutes and save valuable company resources.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
