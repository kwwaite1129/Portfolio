           <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
          <p>Image recognition is a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of use cases throughout any domain. Image recognition is quickly becoming one of the most popular projects for machine learning to automate previously manual tasks performed by a human. In order for an image recognition model to be successful, it must be able to accurately label and categorize images based on the dataset it was trained on. For my second project this semester, I will be taking the Sports Illustrated covers for the past ten years (2010-2019) and running them through a model I created to identify what sport is on the cover of the magazine. </p>
          
          <blockquote class = "blockquote">The global image recognition market size is expected to reach USD 109.4 billion by 2027, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR[Compound Annual Growth Rate] of 18.8% from 2020 to 2027, (Grand View Research, 2020).</blockquote>
          
          <p>Using an image recognition model, the data entry or data governance teams at Sports Illustrated would be able to run these covers through the image recognition model and classify each cover to the sport they belong to. This model, if calibrated correctly, could also perform this classification activity with their entire image library. Instead of having an employee manually go through all of the magazine cover archives and label each magazine cover. The model would be able to do this in a matter of minutes and save valuable company resources.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Sample Sports Illustrated Covers I attempted to classify.</span>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Hypothesis</h2>

          <p>My hypothesis is that I can create a model that will accurately label each Sports Illustrated cover based on the sports portrayed on the main image. Classifying images is no easy task for a machine. The machine cannot differentiate one image from another until it is trained on the differences between the images. I believe with the sports image dataset I am using (more on that below in the data section), I can create an accurate model that will correctly classify each sports image. It would be extremely time consuming to have a person manually go through each Sports Illustrated cover and label what sport is represented with the main cover image. Having this historical data would allow Sports Illustrated to perform various analysis including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What sports sell the most issues?</li>
            <li>Are there any trends for sports based on the season/time of the year?</li>
            <li>What sort of representation is there on the covers?</li>
            <li>Is Sports Illustrated over representing or under representing any societal, cultural, or sport groups?</li>
            <li>If a group is underrepresented, how can we become more inclusive while also increasing sales?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">The Data</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
