           <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
          <p>Baseball is known as America’s pastime. If you are like 20% of Americans (65M people) participating in some kind of fantasy sports (The Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association, 2020), there is a chance you have played fantasy baseball. Daily Fantasy Sports generated revenue of 2.91 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 (Statista, 2020) and is a growing industry thanks to recent legislation that has loosen sports gambling laws in America. The Supreme Court of the United States lifted the federal ban on sports betting on May 14, 2018 (Licata, 2019). Those of us who play fantasy sports are always looking for that extra edge when it comes to drafting their team for the upcoming season. For my first project this semester, I will be taking a look at various baseball player’s statistics from the previous ten seasons to create a model that will predict the fantasy points for a player in the upcoming season. I will then use those predicted next season’s fantasy points to categorize a baseball player as a regression candidate.</p>
          
          <p>A player is said to be a regression candidate if they are expected to “regress to the mean” or have a season that is not as successful as they did the year previously. A regression candidate’s stats would return to normal, lower numbers compared to the previous season. This question would be beneficial for both MLB general managers and fantasy baseball managers (like myself) who are building a team. For the purposes of this project, I will be looking at this model through the lens of a fantasy baseball manager. That is not to say it could not be used by MLB general managers. However, fantasy baseball is how I will be using the model. When identifying if a player is a regression candidate, I will be comparing their expected fantasy points for the upcoming season against the points they had in the previous season. If the player's points are the same or higher than the previous season, then they will not be categorized as a regression candidate. If their expected points decrease by 10% compared to the previous season, then I will categorize them as a regression candidate.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Hypothesis</h2>

          <p>My hypothesis is that I can successfully predict the amount of fantasy points a MLB player will have in the upcoming season based on past performance. When drafting a fantasy baseball team it is all about value and drafting players who can contribute the most to your team at a reasonable cost. If you take a player in the first round who is not able to live up to the expectations of their previous season(s), then your season could be in serious jeopardy. Also, when looking for sleepers or mid-round players who also have a major impact on how your team performs during the regular season, it is important to understand who had a one hit wonder type season and which player’s stats will continue to meet expectations. By looking at a variety of metrics collected on MLB players for the past ten years, I want to create a model that will allow the fantasy manager to identify which players to avoid and which players they can trust in the upcoming season during their draft.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Data</h2>
          
          <!--- <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/sport_image_dataset.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Sample images from the datatset I will be using to train my model.</span> --->

          <p>For this project, I will be examining a database containing complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2020, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records and post-season data. As I mentioned above, although I have access to data going back to 1871, I will only be using data from 2010 through the 2019 season. I am only using the past ten years worth of data because baseball has shifted in playing style over the past ten years. This is mainly a result of increased use of analytics in baseball and shifting strategies due to this analytical adoption. Looking at stats from the 1950s when players were playing baseball a different style is not as useful when looking to identify regression candidates in 2021. Also, I will be excluding the 2020 season from my analysis as this was a shortened season (an outlier) due to the Covid-19 pandemic and will throw off my models.</p>
          
          <p><a href='http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/'><b>Link to the dataset</b> </a></p>
   
          <p>In addition to the data provided by the dataset, I also had to create a couple new features I felt would be important to increase the accuracy of the model. The first column I had to create was the total fantasy points for that season. I used the standard head to head scoring system from CBS Sports to calculate these values (CBS Sports, n.d.). The next field I created was the rolling three year average of the player’s fantasy points. This gives a better snapshot of how the player typically produces compared to just the past season. I also created an overall total average fantasy points for the player. If the player had a one hit wonder season, these metrics will help the model to better understand and identify a regression candidate. Finally, I had to create a new column called Next_Year_FPTS as the dependent variable. It is the same scoring calculation as above for total fantasy points for the current season. However I had to look at the player’s stats from the next season to calculate this dependent variable that I am trying to predict with my test data.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Method</h2>
          
          <p>For the exploratory data analysis portion of the project, I did not have to perform a whole lot of cleaning or manipulating based on the dataset. The dataset was very clean in a csv file. There were only 14 items with missing values in the pitchers data set and none in the batters dataset. Leveraging the Pandas Profiling library, I was able to see a couple of items that may cause issues in my modeling and decide how to fix those issues:</p>
          
          <p>The 9 models I chose to run my data through include:</p>
         
          <ul>
            <li>There were 14 players from 2007 - 2019 that had an ERA as N/A. This is because the pitcher never successfully got a player out. ERA is calculated the total runs given up by the amount of outs a pitcher records. Since these players never recorded an out, the ERA could not be calculated. I dropped these 14 players from my analysis as they were not a significant percent of the population (0.13%) and it is a rare occurrence. I did not want to change this value to 0 because an ERA of 0 is very good and these players did the opposite of very good.</li>
            <li>Due to trades occurring mid-season, a player could show up twice in a given year due to them changing teams/leagues/etc. I wanted to show the total points for this player for the entire year instead of showing total points on one team and total points on another team in one year. I merged these players into one row using a groupby function and then calculated their total fantasy points.</li>
            <li>I kept the pitcher and batter datasets separate because they have different metrics and felt combining them would clutter/overcomplicate the model.</li>
          </ul>
              
          <p>It was reassuring to see that a lot of the variables had a high correlation to the target variable (next_seasons_fpts) and I did not feel the need to drop any of the metrics. I did not feel the model would be cluttered and there would not be too many unnecessary variables.</p>

          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Correlation results for both pitchers and batters</span>
          
          <p>Once the data was collected, inspected, and perfected, I ran my data through seven different regression algorithms to predict MLB players expected fantasy points for the upcoming season. I chose to use regression algorithms to solve this problem because this is a supervised machine learning problem (I know the values of the output and can compare the model against the actual values) and I wanted to predict a continuous variable based on the data fed into my model. The seven models I chose to run my data through include:</p>
           
          <ul>
            <li>Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Decision Tree</li>
            <li>Random Forest</li>
            <li>Naive Bayes</li>
            <li>K-Nearest Neighbor</li>
            <li>Lasso Regression</li>
            <li>Ridge Regression</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>
          
          <p>For my modeling, I first ran each optimizer through a 5 epoch cycle of various learning rates to determine the best learning rate for each optimizer. Then I ran each model through both optimizers (SGD and Adam) at the best performing learning rate. I ran each model through a training session and determined the best epoch for running the test data through the model. Too many epochs, and I would be overfitting the data. Too few epochs, and I would not have an accurate enough model. You can see the Python code for all of these models in my GitHub Repository. After my extensive modeling through all 9 models for each optimizer, below are the results for each model.</p>

          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Results from the 9 models for both SGD and Adam optimizers</span>
          
          <p>As expected, the modeling leveraging the pre-trained VGG-16 covnet performed the best. I was excited to see an accuracy of 62% as when I started out with the simple NN, I was getting accuracy levels in the teens and low 20s. I felt confident that my model was sufficiently tuned and ready to run the Sports Illustrated covers through. Once I transformed the Sports Illustrated covers to an array appropriate for modeling, I ran the data through the VGG-16 Pretrained Covnet with Adam as an optimizer. The model came back lower than I expected with an accuracy rate of 28% and a loss of about 3. The low loss number was reassuring. However, for this model to be used in a real world setting, I would like to see the accuracy much higher than 28%.</p>
          
          <blockquote class = "blockquote">VGG16 is a convolution neural net (CNN ) architecture which was used to win ILSVR (Imagenet) competition in 2014. It is considered to be one of the excellent vision model architectures till date (Thakur, 2020)</blockquote>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          
          <p>In future iterations of this project, I would like to increase the accuracy of the model. This could be done in a variety of different ways in the modeling process. I could also look at isolating the main image and removing any additional details on the cover image that cause unwanted noise for my model. An accuracy of 28% is not as high as I would have hoped for in the beginning of this project. However, I can say that my hypothesis was correct. I was able to create a model that can accurately classify a sports image based on the details and context of the picture. Image recognition will only continue to grow with the increasing power of cell phone cameras as well as the continued adoption of smart cameras like Nest and Ring.</p>
          
          <blockquote class = "blockquote">The advent of digital cameras, particularly cameras built into smartphones, has led to an exponential growth in the volume of digital content in the form of images and videos. A vast amount of visual and digital data is being captured and shared through several applications, websites, social networks, and other digital channels. Several businesses have leveraged this online content to deliver better and smarter services to their customers, with the use of digital image processing. For instance, in October 2019, SnapPay Inc., a U.S. based payment platform provider, launched facial recognition payment technology in the North America region. By using this technology in its payment solution, the company has aimed at allowing its customers a new level of convenience for payments at retail outlets (Grand View Research, 2020).</blockquote>
          
          <p>With the fast paced growth of image collecting technology, the amount of image data that can be collected will increase exponentially. The images collected will only continue to be clearer and image recognition will be a powerful tool used in various places like grocery stores, airports, sports areas. You name it, there is most likely a camera present capturing our every move. Having all of this data to simplify and improve our lives will be a major incentive for companies in the future.</p>
