           <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
          <p>This project was a project soley focused on the data wrangling portion of the data science project lifecycle. For this project, I had to identify, collect, and clean three seperate data sources into one dataset for future modeling purposes. I chose to collect three different datasets that contained various different information on North Carolina Schools. I a variety of different tools and techniques for obtaining and cleaning data within Python. I first had to learn how to extract data from a variety of different sources including a simple csv/excel file to web scraping and APIs. Data wrangling from the csv file was the easiest wrangling task of this project. The file was in a mostly clean format and just needed minor tweaks. Where I really had to dig in and learn new concepts was the web scraping and API ingesting tools. These techniques took quite a bit of data wrangling in order to obtain and clean the data. The data from the API was in JSON format and I had to learn JSON and how to unpack it with Python. For web scraping, I had to decipher the HTML of the web page that contained the data I wanted to capture. Once I identified where the data was stored in the HTML, I had to unpack it and create a data frame out of the column heading and body of the data.</p>
          
          <blockquote class = "blockquote">Data scientists spend 60% of their time on cleaning and organizing data. Collecting data sets comes second at 19% of their time, meaning data scientists spend around 80% of their time on preparing and managing data for analysis, (Gil Press, 2016).</blockquote>
          
          <p>After I had all three of these data sources in a clean, easy to understand format, I had to write these data frames to database tables using SQLite3 in Python. This was an excellent tool that made importing pandas data frames into a SQL database easy. Once the three data sources were in a SQL database, I then had to identify the common keys to merge the data sets on. This was the school ID for the School Grades and School County databases. For the School Region database, this was the school county name. This took some trial and error to understand the different join types and how I had to join for each table. Once all three tables were merged, I was able to properly perform data analysis on my combined data set.</p>
          
          <p>Data visualizations were the third major thing I had to learn and complete for my term project. I used Matplotlib as well as Geopandas to create my visualizations for this project. Matplotlib is an excellent module for data visualizations in Python allowing for countless amount of customization. Geopandas was an interesting package I came across on the internet that allowed me to create a visualization on the state of North Carolina.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Data</h2>
          
          <p>The data I used for this project came from three different sources; a csv files, an API in JSON format, and scraped web data from an HTML website. I will go into further details on each dataset below. </p>
          
          <p>The three data sources have a simple relationship between them. <b>The School Database</b> contains the school name, school ID, and municipality for each school in North Carolina. I then created a lookup on the <b>School District Location</b> data to determine the state region location of the school. I then created a new column with this information called school district region. I then linked these two data sources on school district name from the <b>School District Location</b> data and the municipality from the <b>School Database</b>. The <b>School Grades Data</b> connected to the <b>School Database</b> on the school code number from the <b>School Grades Data</b> and the facility id from the <b>School Database</b></p>
          
          <h4>School District Location (Website Data)</h4>
          
          <p>This site contains all of the school districts in North Carolina, as well as the education district region they reside within. The School District Location contains all of the school districts in North Carolina and state region locations. I will create a new column with this information called school district location.</p> 
          
          <p><a href src='https://stateboard.ncpublicschools.gov/about-sbe/education-districts'><u>Link to data</u></a></p>
          
          <h4>School Grades (CSV File)</h4>
          
          <p>This file contains the school grades for every school in North Carolina for the 2018-2019 school year. The School Grades Data contains all of the state assessed school grades based on the school’s performance on the North Carolina state testing held the previous year. I will link to the School Database on the school code number from the School Grades Data and the facility id from the School Database.</p>
          
          <p><a href src='https://files.nc.gov/dpi/documents/accountability/reporting/spg-report2019_october.xlsx'><u>Link to data</u></a></p>
          
          <h4>School Database (API Data)</h4>
          
          <p>This API contains location information about each school within North Carolina. The School Database contains school location information, including the school name, school ID, and school district for each school in North Carolina. The School Database will be the primary dataset I will use to connect with the other two data sources.</p>
          <p><a href src='https://www.nconemap.gov/datasets/dea6ff0e8b4743a0ba361e13a85a4c70_3/data?orderBy=OBJECTID&orderByAsc=false'><u>Link to data</u></a></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Method</h2>
          
          <p>In order to accomplish this this project, I had to perform different types of data wrangling and transformations on all three data sets. The most challenging data set I had to work with is the School District Location Data. This data is not in an easy to read tabular format. This data is written into chunks on a website page with separate headings for each district location. I needed to use a web page scraper to extract this information into a single table identifying the geographical region for each school district. I then had to create a join with this table and the School District Location Data and create a calculated field to look up each school district and provide the district region for each school. This portion was the most difficult because I did not know how to do either the web scraping or the database lookup/join.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, I had to join the School Grades Data with the School Database on the school code number from the School Grades Data and the facility id from the School Database. These are the unique keys for each school that I can link between the two datasets. This part was not be as difficult as there is a one to one relationship for school each school in each database. The School Grades Data and the School Database are relatively clean data sources. However, I had to do some analysis to review for duplicates, errors in the data, and identifying any additional inconsistencies in the data. Also, I had to ensure every school received a grade. If the school did not receive a grade, I removed those schools. I investigated the reason for a school not having a grade further to ensure the removal will not throw off the analysis, and the schools did not receive a grade for a specific reason.</p>
          
          <blockquote class = "blockquote">select grades_counties.*, regions.Region FROM grades_counties LEFT JOIN regions on grades_counties.COUNTY = regions.COUNTY</blockquote>
          <span class="caption text-muted">SQL used to merge the data together.</span>
          
          <p>After I had all three of these data sources in a clean, easy to understand format, I had to write these data frames to database tables using SQLite3 in Python. This was an excellent tool that made importing pandas data frames into a SQL database easy. Once the three data sources were in a SQL database, I then had to identify the common keys to merge the data sets on. This was the school ID for the School Grades and School County databases. For the School Region database, this was the school county name. This took some trial and error to understand the different join types and how I had to join for each table. Once all three tables were merged, I was able to properly perform data analysis on my combined data set.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Analysis</h2>
          
          <p>Data visualizations were the third major thing I had to learn and complete for my term project. I used Matplotlib as well as Geopandas to create my visualizations for this project. Matplotlib is an excellent module for data visualizations in Python allowing for countless amount of customization. Geopandas was an interesting package I came across on the internet that allowed me to create a visualization on the state of North Carolina. Below are some samples of the visuals I created with the newly merged data I created.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          
          <p>Overall, I throughly enjoyed this project and had fun with each problem that had to be solved for each different data set. All three data sets had their own sets of code and problem solving I had to undertake. However, I learned so much in this class I will be able to take forward with me in my data science career and am looking forward to applying these new tools in my day to day work.</p>

          <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
